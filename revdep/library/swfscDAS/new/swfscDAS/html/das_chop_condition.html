<h2>Chop DAS data - condition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Chop DAS data into a new effort segment every time a specified condition changes
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
das_chop_condition(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
das_chop_condition(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'das_df'
das_chop_condition(
  x,
  conditions,
  seg.min.km = 0.1,
  distance.method = NULL,
  num.cores = NULL,
  ...
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>das_df</code>,
or a data frame that can be coerced to class <code>das_df</code>.
This data must be filtered for continuous effort sections;
see the Details section below</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>ignored</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>conditions</code></td>
<td>
<p>the conditions that trigger a new segment;
see <code><a href="../../swfscDAS/help/das_effort.html">das_effort</a></code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>seg.min.km</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric; minimum allowable segment length (in kilometers).
Default is 0.1. See the Details section below for more information</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>distance.method</code></td>
<td>
<p>character; see <code><a href="../../swfscDAS/help/das_effort.html">das_effort</a></code>.
Default is <code>NULL</code> since these distances should have already been calculated</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>num.cores</code></td>
<td>
<p>see <code><a href="../../swfscDAS/help/das_effort.html">das_effort</a></code></p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>WARNING - do not call this function directly!
It is exported for documentation purposes, but is intended for internal package use only.
</p>
<p>This function is intended to be called by <code><a href="../../swfscDAS/help/das_effort.html">das_effort</a></code>
when the &quot;condition&quot; method is specified.
Thus, <code>x</code> must be filtered for events (rows) where either
the 'OnEffort' column is <code>TRUE</code> or the 'Event' column is &quot;E&quot;;
see <code><a href="../../swfscDAS/help/das_effort.html">das_effort</a></code> for more details.
This function chops each continuous effort section (henceforth 'effort sections')
in <code>x</code> into modeling segments (henceforth 'segments') by
creating a new segment every time a specified condition changes.
Each effort section runs from an &quot;R&quot; event to its corresponding &quot;E&quot; event.
After chopping, <code><a href="../../swfscDAS/help/das_segdata.html">das_segdata</a></code> is called
(with <code>segdata.method = "maxdist"</code>)
to get relevant segdata information for each segment.
</p>
<p>Changes in the one of the conditions specified in the <code>conditions</code>
argument triggers a new segment.
One exception is if the event at which this condition change occurs is part of an event series,
meaning one of several events in a row at the same lat/lon points (such as a PVNW event series).
In this situation, the final event of the event series is considered the last event
of the current effort segment, and thus also the start of the next effort segment.
</p>
<p>Related, when multiple condition changes happen at the same lat/lon points,
such as a &quot;RPVNW&quot; series of events at the beginning of the effort section.
When this happens, no segments of length zero are created;
rather, a single segment is created that includes all of the condition changes
(i.e. all of the events in the event series) that happened during
the series of events (i.e. at the same location).
Note that this combining of events at the same position happens
even if <code>seg.min.km = 0</code>.
</p>
<p>In addition, (almost) all segments whose length is less than <code>seg.min.km</code>
are combined with the segment immediately following them to ensure that the length
of (almost) all segments is at least <code>seg.min.km</code>.
This allows users to account for situations where multiple conditions,
such as Beaufort and the visibility, change in rapid succession, for instance &lt;0.1 km apart.
When segments are combined, a message is printed, and the condition that was
recorded for the maximum distance within the new segment is reported.
See <code><a href="../../swfscDAS/help/das_segdata.html">das_segdata</a></code>, <code>segdata.method = "maxdist"</code>, for more details
about how the segdata information is determined.
The only exception to this rule is if the short segment ends in an &quot;E&quot; event,
meaning it is the last segment of the effort section.
Since in this case there is no 'next' segment,
this short segment is left as-is.
</p>
<p>If the column <code>dist_from_prev</code> does not exist, the distance between
subsequent events is calculated as described in <code><a href="../../swfscDAS/help/das_effort.html">das_effort</a></code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List of two data frames:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>x</code>, with columns added for the corresponding unique segment code and number
</p>
</li>
<li><p> segdata: data frame with one row for each segment, and columns with
relevant data (see <code><a href="../../swfscDAS/help/das_effort.html">das_effort</a></code> for specifics)
</p>
</li></ul>
