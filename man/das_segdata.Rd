\details{
WARNING - do not call this function directly!
  It is exported for documentation purposes, but is intended for internal package use only.

  This function was designed to be called by one of the das_chop_ functions,
  e.g. \code{\link{das_chop_equallength}}, and thus
  users should avoid calling it themselves.
  It loops through the events in \code{x}, chopping \code{x} into modeling segments
  while calculating and storing relevant information for each segment.
  Because \code{x} is a continuous effort section, it must begin with
  a "B" or "R" event and end with the corresponding "E" event.

  For each segment, this function reports the segment number,
  segment ID, cruise number, the start/end/mid coordinates (lat/lon),
  start/end/mid date/times (DateTime), segment length,
  year, month, day, midpoint time, mode, effort type,
  effective strip width sides (number of sides searched),
  and average conditions (which are specified by \code{conditions}).
  The segment ID is designated as \code{section.id} _ index of the modeling segment.
  Thus, if \code{section.id} is \code{1}, then the segment ID for
  the second segment from \code{x} is \code{"1_2"}.
  The start/end coordinates and date/times are interpolated as needed,
  e.g. when using the 'equallength' method.

  When \code{segdata.method} is "avg", the condition values are
  calculated as a weighted average by distance.
  The reported value for logical columns (e.g. Glare) is the percentage
  (in decimals) of the segment in which that condition was \code{TRUE}.
  For character columns, the reported value for each segment is
  the unique value(s) present in the segment, with \code{NA}s omitted,
  pasted together via \code{paste(..., collapse = "; ")}.
  When \code{segdata.method} is "maxdist", the reported values
  are, for each condition, the value recorded for the longest distance
  during that segment (with \code{NA}s omitted).

  Cruise number, mode, effort type, sides searched, and file name are
  also included in the segdata output.
  These values (excluding \code{NA}s) must be consistent across the
  entire effort section, and thus across all segments in \code{x};
  a warning is printed if there are any inconsistencies

  \code{\link[swfscMisc]{bearing}} and \code{\link[swfscMisc]{destination}}
  are used to calculate the segment start, mid, and end points,
  with \code{method = "vincenty"}.
