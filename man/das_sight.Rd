\value{
Data frame with 1) the columns from \code{x}, excluding the 'Data#' columns,
  and 2) columns with sighting information extracted from 'Data#' columns.
  See \code{\link{das_format_pdf}} for more information the sighting information.
  If \code{return.format} is "default", then there is one row for each species of each sighting event;
  if \code{return.format} is "wide", then there is one row for each sighting event;
  if \code{return.format} is "complete", then there is one row for every
  group size estimate for each sighting event.

  The format-specific columns are described in their respective sections.
  The following sighting information columns are included in all return formats:

    Perpendicular distance (km) to sighting    \tab PerpDistKm   \tab Calculated via \code{(abs(sin(Bearing*pi/180) * DistNm) * 1.852)}

  SightNoDaily is a running count of the number of S/K/M/G sightings that occurred on each day.
  It is formatted as 'YYYYMMDD'_'running count', e.g. "20050101_1".
  The GsSchoolBest, GsSchoolHigh, and GsSchoolLow columns are either:
  1) the arithmetic mean across observer estimates for the "default" and "wide" formats, or
  2) the individual observer estimates for the "complete" format.
  Note that for non-"complete" formats, \code{na.rm = TRUE} is used when calculating the mean,
  and thus blank elements of estimates (but not the whole incomplete estimate) are ignored.
  To convert the perpendicular distance back to nautical miles,
  one would divide PerpDistKm by 1.852

\description{
Extract sightings and associated information from processed DAS data
}
\details{
DAS events contain specific information in the 'Data#' columns,
  with the information depending on the event code for that row.
  The output data frame contains columns with this specific information
  extracted to dedicated columns as described below.
  This function recognizes the following types of sightings:
  marine mammal sightings (event codes "S", "K", or "M"),
  marine mammal resights (codes "s", "k", "m"),
  marine mammal subgroup sightings (code "G"),
  marine mammal subgroup resights (code "g"),
  turtle sightings (code "t"),
  pinniped sightings (code "p")
  and fishing vessel sightings (code "F").
  Warnings are printed if all S, K, M, and G events (and only these events) are not
  followed by an A event and at least one numeric event.
  See \code{\link{das_format_pdf}} for more information about events and event formats,

  The \code{return.events} argument simply provides a shortcut for
  filtering the output of \code{das_sight} by event codes

  Abbreviations used in output column names: Gs = group size, Sp = species,
  Nm = nautical mile, Perc = percentage, Prob = probable,
  GsSchool = school-level group size info

  This function makes the following assumptions, and alterations to the raw DAS data:
  \itemize{
    \item "A" events immediately following an S/K/M/G event have
    the same sighting number (Data1 value) as the S/K/M/G event
    \item The 'nSp' column is equivalent to the number of non-\code{NA} values across the
      'Data5', 'Data6', 'Data7', and 'Data8' columns
      for the pertinent "A" event
    \item The following data are coerced to a numeric using
      \code{\link[base:numeric]{as.numeric}}:
      Bearing, Reticle, DistNm, Cue, Method,
      species percentages, and group sizes (including for t, p, and F events).
      Note that if there are any formatting errors and these data are not numeric,
      the function will likely print a warning message
    \item The values for the following columns are capitalized using
      \code{\link[base:chartr]{toupper}}:
      'Birds', 'Photos', 'CalibSchool', 'PhotosAerial', 'Biopsy',
      'TurtleAge', and 'TurtleCapt'
  }
}
\section{The "default" format output}{

  One row for each species of each sighting event, with group size estimates
  calculated via an arithmetic mean across observer estimates
  (using \code{\link[base]{mean}} with \code{na.rm = TRUE})

  Sighting information columns/formats present specifically in the "default" format output:
  \tabular{lll}{
    \emph{Sighting information} \tab \emph{Column name} \tab \emph{Notes}\cr
    Species code          \tab SpCode \tab Boat type or mammal, turtle, or pinniped species codes\cr
    Probable species code \tab SpCodeProb \tab Probable mammal species codes; \code{NA} if none or not applicable\cr
    Group size of species - best estimate \tab GsSpBest \tab
      Arithmetic mean of the product of GsSchoolBest and the corresponding species percentage \cr
    Group size of species - high estimate \tab GsSpHigh \tab
      Arithmetic mean of the product of GsSchoolHigh and the corresponding species percentage \cr
    Group size of species - low estimate \tab GsSpLow \tab
      Arithmetic mean of the product of GsSchoolLow and the corresponding species percentage \cr
  }
}

\section{The "wide" and "complete" format outputs}{

  The "wide" and "complete" options have very similar columns in their output date frames.
  There are two main differences: 1) the "wide" format has one row for each sighting event,
  while the complete format has a row for every observer estimate for each sightings, and thus
  2) in the "wide" format, all numeric information for which there are multiple observer estimates
  (school group size, species percentage, etc.) are averaged across estimated via
  an arithmetic mean (using \code{\link[base]{mean}} with \code{na.rm = TRUE})

  With these formats, note that the species/type code and group size for
  turtle, pinniped, and boat sightings are in their own column

  Sighting information columns present in the "wide" and "complete" format outputs:
  \tabular{lll}{

  }

  ObsEstimate refers to the code of the observer that made the corresponding estimate.
  For the "wide" format, ObsEstimate is a list-column of all of the observer codes
  that provided an estimate.
  Also in the "wide" format, the GsSpBest# columns are the product of
  GsSchoolBest and the corresponding species percentage.
  These numbers, 1 to 4, correspond to the order of the data as it appears in the DAS file
