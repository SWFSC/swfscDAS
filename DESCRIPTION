Description: Process and summarize DAS data files. 
    These files are typically, but do not have to be 
    DAS <https://swfsc-publications.fisheries.noaa.gov/publications/TM/SWFSC/NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFSC-305.PDF> data
    produced by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) program 'WinCruz' 
    <https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/science-data/california-current-marine-mammal-assessment-program>.
    This package standardizes and streamlines basic DAS data processing,
    and includes a PDF with the DAS data format requirements expected by the package.
