This package contains functions for processing and analyzing DAS data
generated by WinCruz for the Southwest Fisheries Science Center.
Functionality includes reading DAS data into a data frame, processing
this data (extracting state and condition information for each DAS
event), and (soon) summarizing sighting and effort information.
