This package contains functions designed for processing and analyzing shipboard DAS data. This package was designed to handle DAS data generated using the [WinCruz software](https://github.com/SWFSC/WinCruz-2.0) from the Southwest Fisheries Science Center. However, the DAS files and the `swfscDAS` package are and can be used by others, e.g. to process decades of NOAA Fisheries survey data. The package is intended to standardize and streamline basic DAS data processing. Functionality currently includes reading DAS data into a data frame, processing this data (extracting state and condition information for each DAS event), and summarizing sighting, effort, and comment information. Learn more in `vignette("swfscDAS")`

## Installation

You can install the released version of swfscDAS from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("swfscDAS")
```

You can install the developmental version of swfscDAS from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("swfsc/swfscDAS")
```

## DAS data format

swfscDAS expects data to follow the conventions and format used by the WinCruz program. You can [download a PDF here](https://github.com/swfsc/swfscDAS/blob/main/inst/DAS_Format.pdf) describing the DAS data format requirements. See `das_format_pdf` for instructions on how to access the local copy of the format PDF that is included in the package.
